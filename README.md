### CM4 with MCC 152 hot-plugging active digital sensors

This board was specifically developed for hot-plugging active digital sensors (e.g., a rotary encoder or a laser photoelectric sensor) into the [MCC-152 DAQ HAT](https://digilent.com/shop/mcc-152-voltage-output-and-dio-daq-hat-for-raspberry-pi/) mounted to the [Raspberry Pi I/O board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4-io-board/) for the [Raspberry Pi CM4 computer](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000). The TVS diode array used is a [Semtech SRDA70-4](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/semtech-corporation/SRDA70-4-TBT/5113686). This diode array is a "rail-to-rail" type device and the clamping voltage is set by the reference supplied and the diode forward bias voltage. For this application, the diode is referenced to 3.3 V. Note that this will put transients on the 3.3 V reference source. For this reason, it is important not to connect this reference to the CM4 3.3 V GPIO pin (I tried this first, and the transients caused the CM4 to reboot on every sensor hot-pugging event). I am now pulling the 3.3 V reference from the dedicated input to 3.3 V DC-DC converter on the RPi I/O board. Note that this converter is for the PCIe connection. I am not using PCIe for this application, so am pulling the 3.3 V power from here. I plan to develop my own I/O board with this dedicated 3.3 V trace without the other PCIe traces in the near future. For now, in my prototyping phase, pulling from any of the several 3.3 V wires from a PCIe extender cable is sufficient. This is a dedicated 3.3 V branch from the input power, and so will not affect the CM4's 3.3 V power circuit.
